# T9Host
a tool for having fun on t9 (BlackOpsColdWar)

This was a little tool i made for hosting fun lobbies on cold war and well i am not good at c# at all lol so it is quite shit, but the options in it i have not seen anyone else have in a tool yet so well yeah have fun with this if you use it :)
the initial offsets in this tool are outdated and i believe are for 1.19.2 so you will have to update them, the signatures should all be valid in the project aswell.
